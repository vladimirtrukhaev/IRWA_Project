# Search Engine with Web Analytics - skeleton project
# IRWA Final Project

This projects contains the startup Flask files for developing a web application.

## Starting the Web App

```bash
python -V
# Make sure we use Python 3

python web_app.py
```
The above will start a web server with the application:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'web-app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8088/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Virtualenv for the project (first time use)
### Install virtualenv
Having different version of libraries for different projects.  
Solves the elevated privilege issue as virtualenv allows you to install with user permission.

In the project root directory execute:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv --version
```
virtualenv 20.10.0

### Prepare virtualenv for the project
In the root of the project folder run:
```bash
virtualenv .
```

If you list the contents of the project root directory, you will see that it has created several sub-directories, including a bin folder (Scripts on Windows) that contains copies of both Python and pip. Also, a lib folder will be created by this action.

The next step is to activate your new virtualenv for the project:
```bash
source bin/activate
```
This will load the python virtualenv for the project.

### Installing Flask and other packages in your virtualenv
```bash
pip install Flask pandas nltk faker
```

Enjoy!
