# IRWA_Project
Based on the learned from theoretical classes, the seminars, the lab exercises and our own research, we are asked to build a search engine implementing different indexing and ranking algorithms.

For each part of the Final Project we will create a new branch with the name of that part and upload the code there e.g. the code for the first part is uploaded in IRWA_Project/IRWA-2021-final-project-part-1 inside a folder.
